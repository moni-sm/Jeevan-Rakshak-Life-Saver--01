# **App Name**: Gaon Swasthya Sahayak

## Core Features:

- Multilingual Health Q&A: Answer user's health-related questions in their local language.
- Emergency Detection: Analyze user-reported symptoms to identify potential emergencies using a tool.
- Hospital Alert: Automatically alert the nearest hospital with the user's location and emergency details. Mock alerting using emails or SMS (no integration with actual services).
- Symptom Input: Enable users to input symptoms via text or voice in their local language.
- Location Services: Acquire and transmit the user's location to hospitals during emergencies (with user consent).
- UI Language Selection: Users should select language from the application. Ensure proper fonts are available.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft teal (#78C2AD) to convey calmness and trustworthiness in health matters.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), almost white, creates a clean, accessible backdrop for the appâ€™s information.
- Accent color: Muted coral (#E9967A) is used to highlight crucial actions and emergency alerts without causing alarm.
- Headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, offering a balance of modernity and accessibility; will also be used for body text, allowing users with a range of literacy levels to effectively use the app.
- Use universally recognizable health and emergency icons. Ensure that iconography does not rely on specific cultural contexts that might exclude user understanding.
- The interface should be straightforward and intuitive, with a clear hierarchy. Critical functions such as emergency reporting should be immediately accessible from the home screen.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations to guide the user through the app. In emergency scenarios, use distinct but non-jarring animations to indicate that a response is in progress.
